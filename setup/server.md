Welcome to our workshop. The first step is to connect to your own compute instance, provided to you by [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=eu-en-b-exoscale&utm_term=exoscale&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=12788996154&gbraid=0AAAAACltiW5lUzUBRaS7Au0ZZINQu2kbU&gclid=CjwKCAiA3L_JBhAlEiwAlcWO52vJFNpgN7y3rlQZJUXoVoxIslviqV2--jvcB-LyM_P0iNqR_YCvMRoCy9sQAvD_BwE).
